abstract: Introduction: Recent studies revealed the association of abnormal methylomic changes with Alzheimers disease (AD) but there is a lack of systematic study of the impact of methylomic alterations over the molecular networks underlying AD. Methods: We profiled genome-wide methylomic variations in the parahippocampal gyrus from 201 post mortem control, mild cognitive impaired, and AD brains. Results: We identified 270 distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with AD. We quantified the impact of these DMRs on each gene and each protein as well as gene and protein co-expression networks. DNA methylation had a profound impact on both AD-associated gene/protein modules and their key regulators. We further integrated the matched multi-omics data to show the impact of DNA methylation on chromatin accessibility, which further modulates gene and protein expression. Discussion: The quantified impact of DNA methylation on gene and protein networks underlying AD identified potential upstream epigenetic regulators of AD.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: DNA methylation was found to have a profound impact on not only the AD-associated gene modules but also key regulators of the gene and protein networks. Key findings were validated in an independent multi-omics cohort in AD. The impact of DNA methylation on chromatin accessibility was also investigated by integrating the matched methylomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data.
