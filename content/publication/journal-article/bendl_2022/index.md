abstract: To characterize the dysregulation of chromatin accessibility in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we generated 636 ATAC-seq libraries from neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei isolated from the superior temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex of 153 AD cases and 56 controls. By analyzing a total of ~20 billion read pairs, we expanded the repertoire of known open chromatin regions (OCRs) in the human brain and identified cell-type-specific enhancer–promoter interactions. We show that interindividual variability in OCRs can be leveraged to identify cis-regulatory domains (CRDs) that capture the three-dimensional structure of the genome (3D genome). We identified AD-associated effects on chromatin accessibility, the 3D genome and transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks. For one of the most AD-perturbed TFs, USF2, we validated its regulatory effect on lysosomal genes. Overall, we applied a systematic approach to understanding the role of the 3D genome in AD. We provide all data as an online resource for widespread community-based analysis.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The authors generated the largest epigenome atlas of postmortem brains with Alzheimer’s disease. They reported regulatory genomic signatures associated with AD, including variability in open chromatin regions, transcription factor networks and cis-regulatory domains.
