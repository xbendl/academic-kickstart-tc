abstract: Mitotic chromosome formation gives genome portions the required compaction and mechanical stability for faithful inheritance during cell divisions. While considered stable entities, mitotic chromosomes are also known to change shape over time [J. Mole-Bajer, Chromosoma 9, 332-358 (1958)]. Here, we record human chromosome dimensions from their appearance in prophase and over successive times in a mitotic arrest. Chromosomes first appear long and uniformly thin. Then, individual chromosome arms become discernible, which continuously shorten and thicken. We find that the longer a chromosome arm, the thicker it becomes over time. The observed chromosome arm length to width relationship can be described by a power law with progressively increasing exponent. In the search for a molecular explanation of this relationship, the popular loop extrusion model provides no obvious means by which longer arms become wider. Instead, we find that simulations of an alternative loop capture model recapitulate key features of our observations, including the gradually developing arm length to width relationship. Our analyses portray chromosomes as out-of-equilibrium structures in the process of transitioning towards, but on biologically relevant time scales not typically reaching, a steady state that can be described as a polymer chain shaped by loop capture interactions. Our observations inform the current discourse on molecular mechanisms of chromosome formation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Mitotic chromosomes progressively shorten and thicken during arrest, with arm width increasing with length according to a time-dependent power law, a pattern best explained by loop capture rather than loop extrusion.
