abstract: Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide, with a projection of 151 million cases by 2050. Previous genetic studies have identified three main genes associated with early-onset familial Alzheimerâ€™s disease, however this subtype accounts for less than 5% of total cases. Next-generation sequencing has been well established and holds great promise to assist in the development of novel therapeutics as well as biomarkers to prevent or slow the progression of this devastating disease. Here we present a public resource of functional genomic data from the parahippocampal gyrus of 201 postmortem control, mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and AD individuals from the Mount Sinai brain bank, of which whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were previously published. The genomic data include bulk proteomics and DNA methylation, as well as cell-type-specific RNA-seq and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) data. We have performed extensive preprocessing and quality control, allowing the research community to access and utilize this public resource available on the Synapse platform at https://doi.org/10.7303/syn51180043.2.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present a new atlas of bulk proteomics and DNA methylation, as well as cell-type-specific RNA-seq and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) data for deeply characterized AD samples.
