abstract: Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells that insulate and support axons with their myelin membrane, allowing proper brain function. Here, we identify lamin A/C (LMNA/C) as essential for transcriptional and functional stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes. We show that LMNA/C levels increase with differentiation of progenitors and that loss of Lmna in differentiated oligodendrocytes profoundly alters their chromatin accessibility and transcriptional signature. Lmna deletion in myelinating glia is compatible with normal developmental myelination. However, altered chromatin accessibility is detected in fully differentiated oligodendrocytes together with increased expression of progenitor genes and decreased levels of lipid-related transcription factors and inner mitochondrial membrane transcripts. These changes are accompanied by altered brain metabolism, lower levels of myelin-related lipids, and altered mitochondrial structure in oligodendrocytes, thereby resulting in myelin thinning and the development of a progressively worsening motor phenotype. Overall, our data identify LMNA/C as essential for maintaining the transcriptional and functional stability of myelinating oligodendrocytes.
