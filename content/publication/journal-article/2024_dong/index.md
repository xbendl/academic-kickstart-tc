abstract: Brain region- and cell-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic features are associated with heritability for neuropsychiatric traits, but a systematic view, considering cortical and subcortical regions, is lacking. Here, we provide an atlas of chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei across 25 distinct human cortical and subcortical brain regions from 6 neurotypical controls. We identified extensive gene expression and chromatin accessibility differences across brain regions, including variation in alternative promoter-isoform usage and enhancer-promoter interactions. Genes with distinct promoter-isoform usage across brain regions were strongly enriched for neuropsychiatric disease risk variants. Moreover, we built enhancer-promoter interactions at promoter-isoform resolution across different brain regions and highlighted the contribution of brain region-specific and promoter-isoform-specific regulation to neuropsychiatric disorders. Including promoter-isoform resolution uncovers additional distal elements implicated in the heritability of diseases, thereby increasing the power to fine-map risk genes. Our results provide a valuable resource for studying molecular regulation across multiple regions of the human brain and underscore the importance of considering isoform information in gene regulation.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Brain gene regulation is key for neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, the authors show that profiling gene expression and chromatin states in 25 brain regions enables enhancer-promoter mapping at isoform resolution, improving genetic fine-mapping.
