abstract: Large-scale genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia have uncovered hundreds of associated loci but with extremely limited representation of African diaspora populations. We surveyed electronic health records of 200,000 individuals of African ancestry in the Million Veteran and All of Us Research Programs, and, coupled with genotype-level data from four case-control studies, realized a combined sample size of 13,012 affected and 54,266 unaffected persons. Three genome-wide significant signals — near PLXNA4, PMAIP1, and TRPA1 — are the first to be independently identified in populations of predominantly African ancestry. Joint analyses of African, European, and East Asian ancestries across 86,981 cases and 303,771 controls, yielded 376 distinct autosomal loci, which were refined to 708 putatively causal variants via multi-ancestry fine-mapping. Utilizing single-cell functional genomic data from human brain tissue and two complementary approaches, transcriptome-wide association studies and enhancer-promoter contact mapping, we identified a consensus set of 94 genes across ancestries and pinpointed the specific cell types in which they act. We identified reproducible associations of schizophrenia polygenic risk scores with schizophrenia diagnoses and a range of other mental and physical health problems. Our study addresses a longstanding gap in the generalizability of research findings for schizophrenia across ancestral populations, underlining shared biological underpinnings of schizophrenia across global populations in the presence of broadly divergent risk allele frequencies.




# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We conducted a large-scale schizophrenia GWAS including over 67,000 individuals of African ancestry, identifying the first genome-wide significant loci in this population and refining 376 loci to 708 causal variants across ancestries, revealing 94 risk genes and shared biological mechanisms despite population-specific allele frequencies.
