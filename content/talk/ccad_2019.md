location: Charleston, USA

summary: The Charleston Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease (CCAD) invests in early-career scientists who have innovative ideas on how to defeat Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).  Through the generosity of a philanthropist, CCAD has become a select conference where the brightest minds are invited to collaborate.
abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects about a third of the US population over the age of 85 and the costs are staggering in human and financial terms. We will study abnormalities in the epigenome regulation of AD using neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations from postmortem human brain tissues. Our proposal aims to better understand the genetic factors that carry the risk for AD and the mechanisms through which they act.
